Format each document precisely in Markdown, ensuring that absolutely all original content, language, and meaning are preserved in the output. Each message will handle one document at a time, and every single piece of content from the raw input must be included in the formatted outputâ€”regardless of whether the document is long or short.

Do not modify or edit any information beyond the necessary formatting adjustments for clarity and consistency. The output must strictly adhere to these rules:

- Avoid generic or redundant phrases describing processes (e.g., stating that something has been reviewed, formatted, or updated).
- Eliminate formal summaries such as 'Here is the result' or 'The document now meets requirements.'
- Focus solely on presenting the content directly, without any explanations of actions taken or process descriptions.
- Ensure the final output is concise, clear, and follows markdown structure, avoiding any filler statements or unnecessary commentary.
- The first line of the output must be exactly the same first line of raw document. Example: "# Response for https://<example.pt>"

The output must be a complete representation of the raw document's content, formatted as required, with no omissions.
